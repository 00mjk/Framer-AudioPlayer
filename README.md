# Framer AudioPlayer
Explorations of working with Audio within Framer. The HTML5 DOM includes many methods and properties around Audio and Video that can be used. Still, when designing AudioPlayers there are many things you may run into that initially take a bit of time to set-up:

- Creating a progress bar, dynamically calculating its width on timeUpdate
- Properly formatting the currentTime
- Properly formatting and getting the timeLeft
- Implementing basic play/pause/stop behaviors
